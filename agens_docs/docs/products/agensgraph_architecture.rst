AgensGraph Architecture
=======================

System Overview
---------------

AgensGraph is built on a robust architecture that combines PostgreSQL's relational capabilities with advanced graph database features. Here's a detailed breakdown of the system components:

Core Components
---------------

1. PostgreSQL Core Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ACID-compliant transaction management
* MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
* Advanced query optimization
* Extensible storage engine

2. Graph Storage Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Property graph model implementation
* Efficient graph traversal algorithms
* Custom graph indexing
* Graph pattern matching

3. Query Optimizer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Cost-based query optimization
* Join ordering optimization
* Index selection
* Statistics-based planning

4. Transaction Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ACID transaction support
* Deadlock detection
* Transaction isolation levels
* Recovery mechanisms

5. Security Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Role-based access control
* SSL/TLS encryption
* Audit logging
* Data encryption at rest

Data Model
----------

1. Relational Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Tables and views
* Constraints and triggers
* Indexes and sequences
* Custom data types

2. Graph Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Nodes and relationships
* Properties and labels
* Path patterns
* Graph constraints

Storage Architecture
--------------------h

1. Data Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Table data files
* Index files
* Graph storage files
* WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)

2. Memory Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Shared buffers
* Work memory
* Maintenance memory
* Graph cache

Performance Features
--------------------
