Graph RAG
=========

A Graph DB-based RAG solution that maximizes the performance of generative AI.

Overview
--------

Graph RAG is an innovative solution that combines the power of Graph Databases with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the performance and accuracy of generative AI systems.

Features
--------

* Graph-based knowledge representation
* Advanced semantic search capabilities
* Real-time data processing
* Scalable architecture
* Integration with major LLM providers

Getting Started
---------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install skai-graph-rag

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   from skai.graph_rag import GraphRAG

   # Initialize the system
   rag = GraphRAG(
       graph_db_uri="neo4j://localhost:7687",
       model_name="gpt-4"
   )

   # Query the system
   response = rag.query("What are the key features of Graph RAG?")

Architecture
------------

The system consists of the following components:

1. Graph Database Layer
2. Vector Store
3. LLM Integration
4. Query Processing Engine
